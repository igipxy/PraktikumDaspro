    1. If in for loop, the initialization i = 1 is changed to i = 0, what is the result? How can It be like that?
- if we input 5 then the star output will be 6 character, because it start with 0 it count as 6 character from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
    2. If in for loop, condition i <= N is changed to i > N, what is the result? How can It be like that?
- no stars are printed and the program exits immediately
    3. If in for loop, the condition for step i++ is changed to i-- what is the result? How can It be like that?
- the program will be looping forever, because i-- will decrease until forever in negative

Questions!
    1. Pay attention to outer loop. If in for syntax, the initialization iOuter = 1 is changed to
iOuter = 0, what is the result? How can it be like that?
- The loop will run from 0 to N, printing N+1 rows instead of N rows, because the loop includes both the starting value 0 and the ending value 5
    2. Return the program to normal with initialization iOuter = 1. Then pay attention to the inner loop. If in for syntax, the initialization i = 1 is changed to i = 0, what is the result? How can it be like that?
       - Each row will have N+1 stars instead of N stars, because
    3. What is the difference between outer loop and inner loop?
    
    4. Why is it necessary to add the syntax System.out.println(); under inner loop? What will happen if the syntax is omitted?
